# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Estonian companiesâ€™ economic activities by combining basic company data from the Business Register with economic activity areas from the MTR (Main Economic Activity Registry). The goal is to identify sector trends, regional differences, and company activity patterns across Estonia.

Stakeholders   
1. Data Analysts
2. Policymakers
3. Investors
4. Banks and Financial Institutions
5. Public and Media

Key Metrics (KPIs)
1. Number of activity notices per company
2. Share of companies with expired activity notices

Business Questions
1. How many companies have multiple activity notices and operate in multiple sectors?
2. How many companies registered their economic activity areas in the same year they were established?
3. How many companies have terminated at least one economic activity notice?
4. Average duration of an activity notice before expiration
5. Percentage of companies with all activity notices expired

Datasets
1. Basic Company Data (Business Register)
359,816 rows, 14 columns
Key columns: Name, Register code, Legal form, Status, First entry date, Address, Location codes

2. Notice of Economic Activities (Economic Activity Register)
35,769 rows, 9 columns
Key columns: Number, Entrepreneur name, Register code, Start & End date, Valid, Field of activity, Type of area of activity and Additional_info 

You can create fact and dimension tables with this SQL script

```sql

-- 1. FACT TABLES
-- =====================================================

-- 1.1 Company Fact Table
-- Grain: 1 row per company (per business register code)
CREATE TABLE fact_companies (
    fact_company_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    dim_companies_id INT NOT NULL,
    dim_legal_form_id INT NOT NULL,
    dim_status_id INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (dim_companies_id) REFERENCES dim_companies(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (dim_legal_form_id) REFERENCES dim_legal(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (dim_status_id) REFERENCES dim_status(id)
);

-- 1.2 MTR Fact Table

CREATE TABLE dim_legal (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    legal_form VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    legal_form_subtype VARCHAR(100)
);

-- 2.3 Status Dimension (SCD Type 0)
CREATE TABLE dim_status (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    status_code VARCHAR(50),
    status_name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- 2.4 Date Dimension (SCD Type 0)
CREATE TABLE dim_date (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    year INT CHECK (year BETWEEN 1900 AND 2100),
    month INT CHECK (month BETWEEN 1 AND 12),
    day INT CHECK (day BETWEEN 1 AND 31)
);

-- 2.5 Activity Dimension (SCD Type 0)

Demo Queries
1. How many companies have multiple activity notices and operate in multiple sectors?  

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS company_count
FROM (
    SELECT dim_companies_id
    FROM fact_mtr
    GROUP BY dim_companies_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT dim_activity_id) > 1
       AND COUNT(DISTINCT mtr_registry_code) > 1
) AS sub;
```
 

2. How many companies registered their economic activity areas in the same year they were established? 

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dim_companies_id) AS same_year_company_count
FROM fact_mtr
JOIN dim_companies ON fact_mtr.dim_companies_id = dim_companies_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM fact_mtr.valid_from) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM dim_companies.initial_registration_date);
```

3. How many companies have terminated at least one economic activity notice?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dim_companies_id) AS terminated_company_count 
FROM fact_mtr 
WHERE expiry_date < CURRENT_DATE 
```
 

4. What is the average duration of an activity notice before it expires? 
```sql
SELECT  
    ROUND(AVG(DATE_PART('day', expiry_date - start_date)), 2) AS avg_notice_duration_days 
FROM fact_mtr 
WHERE expiry_date IS NOT NULL AND start_date IS NOT NULL 
```
 

5. Percentage of companies with all activity notices expired? 
```sql
SELECT  
    ROUND( 
        100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN all_expired THEN 1 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT dim_companies_id), 2) AS percentage_expired_companies 
FROM ( 
    SELECT  
        dim_companies_id, 
        MAX(expiry_date) < CURRENT_DATE AS all_expired 
    FROM fact_mtr 
    GROUP BY dim_companies_id 
) AS company_status 
```
